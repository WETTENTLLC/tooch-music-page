# Tooch Music Page - Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. Run `organize.bat` to ensure all files are in the correct directories
2. Run `cleanup.bat` to remove duplicate and old files
3. Run `check-deployment.bat` to verify all required files are present
4. Test the site locally to ensure all features work as expected

## Deploying to a Web Server

### Option 1: Traditional Web Hosting

1. Upload all files and folders to your web hosting account using FTP
2. Ensure you maintain the directory structure:
   ```
   /
   ├── css/
   │   └── style.css
   ├── js/
   │   ├── auth.js
   │   ├── dashboard.js
   │   ├── main.js
   │   └── player.js
   ├── dashboard.html
   ├── index.html
   ├── login.html
   └── README.md
   ```
3. Test the live site to ensure all resources load correctly

### Option 2: GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push all files to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings
4. Select the branch to deploy (usually `main`)
5. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

### Option 3: Netlify/Vercel

1. Create an account on Netlify or Vercel
2. Connect your GitHub repository or upload the files directly
3. Configure build settings (not required for this static site)
4. Deploy the site
5. You can configure a custom domain if desired

## Post-Deployment Tasks

1. Test all pages on desktop and mobile devices
2. Verify that the music player works correctly
3. Test the login functionality
4. Check that all links work as expected

1. Implementing server-side authentication
2. Using HTTPS for all connections
3. Setting up proper CORS headers
4. Adding rate limiting for login attempts
5. Storing user data securely in a database
